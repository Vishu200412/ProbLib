# ProbLib: C++ Probability and Markov Chain Library

## Key Features

- **Header-Only Design**: ProbLib integrates seamlessly into your projects as a single header file (`ProbLib.h`).
- **Probability Distributions**: The library offers functions for common distributions, including:
  - Geometric
  - Poisson
  - Binomial
  - Exponential
  - Normal

- **Markov Chain Analysis**: Analyze Markov chains with functionalities for:
  - Periodicity detection
  - Reducibility detection
  - Ergodicity detection
  - Steady-state distribution calculation
  - N-step transition probability calculation

- **Error Handling**: ProbLib incorporates informative error messages for invalid user inputs.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Optimized implementations improve code performance.
- **Readability**: Syntax resembles mathematical notation for clear understanding.
- **Maintainability**: ProbLib handles memory management and error checking.

## How to Use

1. **Include the header**:
   ```cpp
   #include "ProbLib.h"
2. Utilize the provided classes and functions for your probability and Markov chain analysis needs.
